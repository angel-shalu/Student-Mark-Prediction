# 📘 Student Mark Predictor – Linear Regression Model

This project predicts student marks based on their study hours using a simple and accurate Linear Regression machine learning model.

# ✅ Project Overview

The script student_mark_predictor_model.py:

Loads and preprocesses a dataset

Removes missing values

Splits data into training & testing sets

Trains a Linear Regression model

Evaluates accuracy

Plots the regression line

Saves the model as .pkl

Loads the saved model and performs a sample prediction

This project helps beginners understand how machine learning models work end-to-end.
